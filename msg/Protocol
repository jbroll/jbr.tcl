 Basic MMTI Messaging Protocol Specification.

 1. Newline terminated variable length ASCII message packet. 

 2. Packet Format.

	[#] command args\n


    A. Optional Packet Number.

	A missing or 0 message number indicates that no acknowledgement of
	the message is expected.  Packet numbers for server packets are
	even, numbers for client packets are odd.

    B. Command and Args.

	The message body is made up of any characters between the message
	number and the terminator.  A command may not begin with a numeric
	character or it may be mistaken for a message number.

    C. Terminator.

	A Newline character terminates the message.

 3. Message length.

    The length of a message is not implicitly limited by the protocol.
    Currently the Hectospec Messaging library limits messages to:

	#define MsgBufferSize   512

    This could be fixed by replacing ReadLine with SlurpLine and
    does not limit the command dependent data part of the message.

 5. Commands.

    No commands are specifically defined in the protocol.

    The mmti library defines:

	set	- set a value
	get	- get a value

	ack	- positive acknowledge and return value.
	blk	- positive acknowledge and data block.
	nak	- negative acknowledge and return error.

	sub	- subscribe to a value
	uns	- unsubscribe to a value

	lst	- list available server commands

 4. Inter Packet Data

    Commands may define inter packet data.  The sender and receiver of this
    data must each agree to write/read exactly the same number of bytes or
    define a logical EOF character.

    There is no provision for protocol resyncronization if commands get
    confused sending or receiving interpacket data.
