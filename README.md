Tcl files that I use every day.

  Tcl's detractors like to harsh on the Tcl mantra "every thing is a string".  I
  like consider a corollary of this : Code is data is code.  Tcl is not so
  much a programming language in the traditional sense. It is a set of
  primitives to pass data and control scope.


My code:
  * 3d.tcl	: 3d matrix transformations.
  * deadfish.tcl	: An implimentation of the deadfish language (maybe not everyday).
  * dxf		: DXF drawing exchange file operations.
  * dict.tcl	: Extensions to the Tcl dict data type.
  * fits.tcl	: A small Tcl FITS reader.
  * func.tcl	: Handy functional procs for Tcl.
  * iter.tcl	: A coroutine generator generator.
  * layout	: A DSL for the construction of Tk interfaces.
  * starbase.tcl	: Read/Write ASCII TSV tables.
  * string.tcl	: Extensions to the Tcl string data type.
  * tcloo.tcl	: Tcl OO helpers.
  * template.tcl	: Template expansion helpers.
  * trace.tcl	: Tcl executon trace helper.
  * [unix.tcl](https://github.com/jbroll/jbr.tcl/wiki/unix.tcl)	: UNIX commands as Tcl procs.


Borrowed/Enhanced Code:

  * 2d.tcl	: 2d matrix transformations.
  * perm.tcl	: A permutations generator.
  * set.tcl	: Set opperations on Tcl lists.
  * vector.tcl	: Operations on lists as N-dimensional vectors.
